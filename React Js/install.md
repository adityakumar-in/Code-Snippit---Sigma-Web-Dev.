# React Project Setup with Vite

This guide will help you get started with a React project using Vite, a fast build tool that provides a modern development experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which you will use to install packages.

## Setting Up a New React Project with Vite

### 1. Create a New React App

Use the following command to create a new React project with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Replace `project-name` with `.` when you want to create React Js in your current folder

### 2. Navigate to Your Project Directory

Change to the directory of your new React project:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the project’s dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

To start the development server and open your new React app in the browser, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server and open your app in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Project Structure

- `public/`: Contains static assets like images.
- `src/`: Contains the React components, styles, and application logic.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file where your React app is injected.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.
- `package.json`: Lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `node_modules/`: Contains the project's dependencies.

## Additional Commands

- **Install Dependencies:** If you need to install additional packages, use:

  ```bash
  npm install package-name
  ```

- **Build for Production:** To create a production build of your app, use:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Preview Production Build:** To preview the production build locally, use:

  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

## Customization

- **Modify Components:** Edit files in the `src/` directory to customize your app’s components and functionality.
- **Add Styles:** Update `src/App.css` or add new CSS files to style your components.
- **Configure Vite:** Adjust settings in `vite.config.js` to modify the Vite configuration as needed.
